        <p>
            I live in Minnesota with my girlfriend and our three dogs. My hobbies include gaming with friends, visiting family, traveling and dog sports.
            I've always had interest in computers; whether that was gaming or exploring their inner workings.
            I originally became interested in cybersecurity through the Darknet Diaries podcast.
            After being introduced to these concepts I realized I had a desire to learn more about them. After some exploration I decided that going through a cybersecurity bootcamp was the best route.
            I've enjoyed every aspect of bootcamp and look forward to learning new topics.
            I hope to make this my permanent career path. This blog will serve to highlight some of the important topics I have learned about as I begin my journey into cybersecurity.

                <h3>Why Ban Tiktok?</h3>
                <h4>TikTok</h4>
                <p>The ban on TikTok has been a hot topic in the news as of late. Starting in late December of 2022, Congress passed legislation that has banned the use of the app on all government
                   devices. More than a dozen states were soon to follow. This has been due mainly to the fact that the app is a owned by a Chinese company that is beholden to Chinese law. Several
                   concerns over the collection of personal data have been the catalyst of these actions. Intelligence operations see any piece of data as useful and widespread information collection
                   from those at the higher levels of government would be of interest. TikTok is hardly the first social media app to face this type of criticism. For example, members of the CIA and NSA are
                   unlikely to have facebook accounts. Removing social media apps from government devices can close one door on foreign intelligence. However, continued vigiliance to cybersecurity will be
                   the best means to mitigate the breach of useful information.

                <h3>The Dangers of Phishing</h3>
                <h4>phishing</h4>
                <p>
                    Phishing continues to be one of the most persistent vectors of attack for bad actors. This is because humans are prone to making mistakes. All it takes is one misstep and
                    an attacker will find exactly what they are looking for. Bad actors have not let up in their continued pursuit of information.
                    A recent survey by Osterman Research revealed security teams are spending one-third of their time with phishing threats. This extends beyond email to things like messaging apps and file
                    sharing platforms. The continued efforts of cybersecurity professionals have forced the phishers to develop ever more sophisticated systems.
                    This sophistication comes in the form of not only delivery but also in avoiding detection.
                    Organizations should continue to have regular trainings.
                    It is important that users are kept informed and up to date. This is even more true as working remote or on cloud based systems becomes more of the norm.
